# Chapter 2: Module 2 Lesson Plan

# Overview

**Learning Objectives**

    - Simplify code using for loops for repeated actions.
    - Update the values of variables within loops.
    - Include loops in sequence with other types of code statements.

**Standards**

This module was designed to align to the following standards:

    - CSTA Standards
        - 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.
        - 1A-AP-11: Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
        - 1B-AP-10: Create programs that include sequences, events, loops, and conditionals.

# Content Background

- Key Terms
    - **For loop**: A structure that allows other statements/sequences of code to be repeated a specific number of times.
    - **Increment**: Increasing the value of something, in this case a variable within a loop.
- Explanation of instructional pathway
    - The second module of Chapter 2 introduces for loops to students. This comes before a module about nesting if statements and for loops within other for loops.

# **Narrative Background**

The hero and Mouse find themselves in Haven with Capella, who has aged 20 years since they saw her last. She explains how the time storms have messed with Haven and recruits the hero to help her clean things up. She then tells them that they must find the time totem which is in a place called the Rift, and only the hero can go there because they have the Acodus. Octans helps the hero navigate to the Rift.

# Instructional Tips

**Common Student Misconceptions**

- Students may struggle with setting up their loops. 
    - Python: Students may be confused about what the range(number) function does in the loop. Remind them that the number they put in the range function will show them how many times the code inside will be repeated.
    - JavaScript: Students may be confused about setting the i variable initially to 0. Write out an example to show them what i is equal to each time they run their loop.

**Differentiation**

- Have students who finish early look up while loops, which will be covered in Module 4. Have them write down the similarities and differences between while and for loops based on their research.
- Have students who are struggling trace their code on paper, writing what each variable is equal to / drawing out the hero or Mouse&#39;s path for each cycle of the loop.
