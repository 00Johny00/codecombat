# Chapter 2: Module 1 Lesson Plan

# Overview

**Learning Objectives**

    - Identify and fix code errors and logic problems.
    - Explain the difference between the basic data types.
    - Differentiate between objects, methods, and arguments.
    - Update the value of variables using basic operations.

**Standards**

This module was designed to align to the following standards:

    - CSTA Standards
        - 1B-AP-09: Create programs that use variables to store and modify data.
        - 2-AP-11: Create clearly named variables that represent different data types and perform operations on their values.
        - 1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.
        - 1A-AP-15: Using correct terminology, describe steps taken and choices made during the iterative process of program development.

# Content Background

- Key Terms
    - **Variable**: Used to store information that is needed later in a program
    - **Data Type**: A classification of data that helps the computer process and understand it. Data types covered in Module 1 include:
        - Integers (Python) - the same as integers in mathematics
        - Floats (Python) - numbers with decimal values
        - Numbers (JavaScript) - includes both integers and floats
        - Strings (Python &amp; JavaScript) - text made up of characters, identified by quotation marks around strings
        - Booleans (Python &amp; JavaScript) - true and false values
    - **Object**: In object-oriented programming (not yet explained to students), an object is an instance of a larger class that helps organize code into sets of methods and attributes. In Module 1, students only need to understand that objects have specific methods and properties associated with them and are used to organize their code.
    - **Method**: An action or function that is associated with an object.
    - **Argument**: A value that can be input into a method to cause a specific behavior. 
- Explanation of instructional pathway
    - The first module of Chapter 2 serves as a review and clarification of concepts in Module 1.

# **Narrative Background**

The hero and Vega have to find another Star Well to defeat the Darkness, and to get to it they have to travel through the Phoenix Lands. In the Phoenix Lands, strange things happen with time. When they arrive, they find Octans and Vega experiences some strange glitches. The hero and Octans head to a safe place called Haven where they won&#39;t be affected by these strange time blips.

# Instructional Tips

**Common Student Misconceptions**

- Students may be used to having operations happen on the opposite side of the equal sign, like in math (1+1 = 2). Explain that the assignment operator works differently from the equals sign in math, and that the mathematical expression should come after the assignment operator.

**Differentiation**

- For students who finish early, you can have them research a different programming language (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.) and identify the differences each language has in saving/classifying data types.
- For students who are struggling with the variable operation levels and concepts, have them draw out on paper the paths that they want the hero/Mouse to travel. Have them do this to plan out their code before they write it in the code editor.
