# Ozaria Implementation Options

As one of the first teachers to use Ozaria in the classroom, you have a few options about how to integrate the Ozaria experience into other CodeCombat content. If you complete all Ozaria content your students will have covered the following concepts:

- *Prologue: The Sky Mountain*: sequences, objects, methods, game development basics
- *Chapter 1: The Moon Dancers*: basic syntax, debugging, variables, conditionals
- *Chapter 2: The Phoenix Lands*: data types, for loops, iteration, nesting, while loops

After completing this content, there are three pathways through the CodeCombat curriculum, depending on the focus of your course:

## Options for Bridging from Ozaria to CodeCombat

| Option | Who should choose this pathway? | Course Sequence |
