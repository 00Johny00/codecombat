##### Capstone Rubric: Prologue
# Sample Rubric: Hungry Hungry Avatars

This sample rubric is designed for you to evaluate your students&#39; progress on their Capstone projects for _Prologue: The Sky Mountain._ It assumes that students completed the Capstone project in the game and that they completed the reflection activity included in the [Prologue: The Sky Mountain Lesson Plan](https://www.ozaria.com/teachers/resources/1fhLessonPlan). You should feel free to adapt and expand this rubric as needed for your classroom â€” keep in mind the learning objectives of this introductory unit:

- Modify sequences to complete a goal.
- Distinguish between objects, methods, and arguments.
- Use arguments in methods to update object properties.
- Set properties of game objects to influence game experience for players.
