# Chapter 1: Up The Mountain

## Overview

Welcome to Ozaria! This Lesson Plan will help you ensure smooth implementation of this immersive game-based learning experience for your computer science students. _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_ will help your students get familiar with the code editor and build confidence applying coding skills to larger projects.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this Ozaria unit, students will be able to:

- Modify sequences to complete a goal.
- Distinguish between objects, methods, and arguments.
- Use arguments in methods to update object properties.
- Set properties of game objects to influence game experience for players. 

### CSTA Standards

This was designed to align to the following K-12 CSTA standards:

- 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.
- 1A-AP-11: Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
- 1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.
- 1B-AP-12: Modify, remix, or incorporate portions of an existing program into one’s own work, to develop something new or add more advanced features.
- 1B-AP-15: Test and debug (identify and fix errors) in a program or algorithm to ensure it runs as intended.


## Recommended Prep

For technical prep and classroom setup, see the [Ozaria Getting Started Guide](/teachers/resources/getting-started).

_Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_ will introduce the following:

   - Content Topics:
       - Sequences
       - Objects
       - Methods with Parameters
       - Properties
   - Skills:
       - Navigating a Code Editor
       - Iterating on Existing Code
       - Creative Game Design
       - Giving and Receiving Feedback

To prepare to support students as they work through _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_, it is highly recommended that you:

1. Work through _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_ on your own.
    - As you’re working through, note down places where you were tripped up or had misunderstandings. These will likely be the same places where students struggle.
    - Get familiar with all the systems within the code editor including:
        - Goals
            - Check off automatically as students complete various checkpoints in the levels and projects. 
            - Ensure students use these to guide their work on levels and milestones. 
        - Code Bank
            - A resource for students to see methods and tools they can use in their programs. This will give them descriptions of each method/tool and examples to work from. 
            - Ensure students look at these before asking about what step they should take next in problem-solving.
        - Error Messages
            - These will pop up automatically when students have errors, either in syntax or logic. 
            - Ensure students read these to understand where in their code something has gone wrong.
        - Autocomplete
            - Autocomplete will allow students to see options for methods when they type key characters and character sequences. Autocomplete will be turned off for Capstone levels to encourage students to read and apply Code Bank documentation.
2. Save the URL to your game to share as an example for students during class.

## In Classroom

### Lesson Facilitation

Since this is the first unit of Ozaria content, explain to students that they will be trying out a brand-new game designed to help them learn computer science.

Once they have started in _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_, students will be able to move through at their own pace. If you would like to stop students at key checkpoints (refer to the [Chapter 1 Unit Overview](/teachers/resources/ch1UnitOverview) as a roadmap) to make sure the class is on the same page, you could do so in the following ways:

1. Have students pause once they reach a new Cutscene, and watch Cutscenes together as a class.
    - When to use this method: When you have students who usually work at roughly the same pace and you want students to be roughly at the same place in the narrative to foster a sense of class community.
2. Have students pause once they reach the beginning of the Capstone project.
    - When to use this method: When you want time to introduce the project and go over the rubric so students are aware of the expectations set for them.

You can also use multiple of these methods mixed together if you believe it would benefit students to be paced similarly.

### Common Student Misconceptions

1. Students, especially those coming from drag-and-drop programming language backgrounds, may struggle with the transition to typed code. If you find that a large number of students are having trouble adjusting to typing in code, you can do a demo where you work step-by-step through a level and explain your steps along the way.
2. Syntax is not explicitly explained in these levels, but students may encounter syntax errors. Help them fix these by referring to examples in the Code Bank and the starter code in levels.
3. The beginning four levels have a different structure from the Capstone levels. In the beginning four levels, students are running their code in sequence to complete a goal. In the Capstone, students are using methods to set properties and update their game. Make sure to clarify this distinction with students if they are thrown off by the different behavior.
    - In the Capstone levels, students must press the Update button to make the settings update to reflect their code, and then they have to press the Play button in the lefthand corner of the animation screen. 

### Reflection Activity

**Summary**

This reflection activity will help students connect the decisions they made while creating their games with design processes and computer science concepts. Students will analyze and give feedback on a peer’s game in order to better understand their own.

**Materials**

1. Sticky notes
2. Pens

**Time**

20 minutes

**Directions**

1. Have students copy and paste their game URL and send it or share it with another member of the class. You could facilitate this by using a shared spreadsheet with students’ names in one column and their game URLs in the second.
2. Pair students up randomly, ensuring that each student contributes feedback to at least one peer’s project.
3. Have them label three different sticky notes, one with What?, one with How?, and one with Why?.
4. Students should open up and play through their partner’s game, answering the following questions.

**Questions**

1. For the What sticky note, students should answer the following questions:
    - What are the major visual differences between the game you created and your partner’s?
        _Example student response: My partner’s game used ghost avatars and an underwater background, but I used snake avatars and a space background._
    - What are the major functional differences between the game you created and your partner’s? 
        _Example student response: My power ups caused the avatars to increase in size, but my partner’s had them increase in speed._
2. For the How sticky note, students should answer the following questions:
    - How did your partner change properties to get their game to look the way it does?
        _Example student response: They changed the minimum size to be very low, so the avatars could shrink to be very small._
    - How could your partner have changed their game to make it more difficult? Easier?
        _Example student response: They could have made the maximum speed higher, because the avatars moved pretty slowly which made the game easier. They could have removed some of the obstacles they included to make it easier._
3. For the Why sticky note, students should answer the following questions:
    - Did you find your game or your partners more fun to play? Why?
        _Example student response: I thought my partner’s game was more fun to play because they included obstacles and I didn’t._
    - Did you find your game or your partners more difficult to win? Why (what properties &amp; their settings made it harder or easier)?
        _Example student response: My partner’s game was more difficult to win because they had more obstacles made the avatars shrink to become very small, and then I would have to eat a lot of other avatars to get bigger again._

### Extensions and Differentiation
**Extensions for advanced students**
- Challenge students to create two versions of their game, one that is &quot;easy&quot; and one that is more difficult.
- Have students look at a game that they play regularly, and answer the following questions:
    - What is an object in this game?
    - What are some properties of this object?
    - What is the input method from the player?
    - What are the directions for the player?
    - Are there any things that you would design differently? Why or why not?

**Differentiation for students who are struggling**
- Direct students to go back to the map and re-watch Cinematics that will help them in Capstone stages.
