# Overview

Welcome to Ozaria&#39;s Hour of Code, _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain!_ This activity will help your students get familiar with the text-based coding and build confidence applying these skills to creating games and projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

- Modify sequences to complete a goal.
- Distinguish between objects, methods, and arguments.
- Use arguments in methods to update object properties.
- Customize a game by changing object properties.

## CSTA Standards

This activity was designed to align to the following K-12 CSTA standards.

- 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.
- 1A-AP-11: Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
- 1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.
- 1B-AP-12: Modify, remix, or incorporate portions of an existing program into oneâ€™s own work, to develop something new or add more advanced features.
- 1B-AP-15: Test and debug (identify and fix errors) in a program or algorithm to ensure it runs as intended.

# Background

_Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_ will introduce the following:

- **Content:** 
    - Sequences
    - Objects
    - Methods with Parameters
    - Properties
- **Skills**
    - Navigating a Code Editor
    - Iterating on Existing Code
    - Creative Game Design

To prepare to support students as they work through _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_, it is highly recommended that you:

Get familiar with all the systems within the code editor including:

**Goals**

            1. Check off automatically as students complete various checkpoints in the levels and projects. 
            1. Ensure students use these to guide their work on levels and milestones. 

**Code Bank**

            1. A resource for students to see methods and tools they can use in their programs. This will give them descriptions of each method/tool and examples to work from. 
            1. Ensure students look at these before asking about what step they should take next in problem-solving.

**Error Messages**

            1. These will pop up automatically when students have errors, either in syntax or logic. 
            1. Ensure students read these to understand where in their code something has gone wrong.

**Vega Messages**

            1. Messages that serve as additional hints and support.
            1. Both include introductory messages and, in some levels, messages triggered by specific interaction.

# In Classroom

## Facilitation

Once they have started in _Chapter 1: Up The Mountain_, students will be able to move through at their own pace.

## Common Student Misconceptions

1. Students, especially those coming from drag-and-drop programming language backgrounds, may struggle with the transition to typed code. If you find that a large number of students are having trouble adjusting to typing in code, you can do a demo where you work step-by-step through a level and explain your steps along the way.
1. Syntax is not explicitly explained in these levels, but students may encounter syntax errors. Help them fix these by referring to examples in the Code Bank and the starter code in levels.
1. The beginning four levels have a different structure from the Capstone levels. In the beginning four levels, students are running their code in sequence to complete a goal. In the Capstone, students are using methods to set properties and update their game. Make sure to clarify this distinction with students if they are thrown off by the different behavior.
    1. In the Capstone levels, students must press the Update button to make the settings update to reflect their code, and then they have to press the Play button in the lefthand corner of the animation screen. 

## Extensions and Differentiation

1. Extensions for advanced students
    1. Challenge students to create two versions of their game, one that is &quot;easy&quot; and one that is more difficult.
    1. Have students look at a game that they play regularly, and answer the following questions:
        1. What is an object in this game?
        1. What are some properties of this object?
        1. What is the input method from the player?
        1. What are the directions for the player?
        1. Are there any things that you would design differently? Why or why not?
1. Differentiation for students who are struggling
    1. Direct students to go back to the map and re-watch Cinematics that will help them in Capstone stages.
