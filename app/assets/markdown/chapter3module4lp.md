# Chapter 3: Module 4 Lesson Plan

# Overview

**Learning Objectives**

   - Trace updating of a variable within a while loop.
   - Determine whether it is best to use a for loops or a while loop for a given puzzle.
   - Use while loops to condense code.

**Standards**

This module was designed to align to the following standards:

   - CSTA Standards
       - 1A-AP-09: Model the way programs store and manipulate data by using numbers or other symbols to represent information.
       - 1B-AP-09: Compare and refine multiple algorithms for the same task and determine which is the most appropriate.
       - 1B-AP-11: Decompose (break down) problems into smaller, manageable subproblems to facilitate the program development process.

# Content Background

- Key Terms
    - **While Loop:** A loop that repeats actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.
    - **Counter Variable**: A variable used to set a while loop condition that increments within the while loop.
- Explanation of instructional pathway
    - The fourth module of Chapter 3 introduces nested structures. This comes after a module about nested structures and before the unit culminating Capstone project.

# **Narrative Background**

The hero and Mouse venture into Haven even though the ruler, Yug, has exiled all humans from the city. They place the Time Totem at the center of the city in order to stop the Time Storm which has been making people disappear. They save the city and Yug lets all the humans back in.

# Instructional Tips

**Common Student Misconceptions**

- Watch out for infinite loops!
    - While loops are tricky because students can create loops that end up running forever if the condition never becomes false. This will make it impossible to move past the while loop in their code, and it might be tricky for students to debug. Have the students identify when they expect the condition they have set in the while loop to change to false, and determine whether that happens. If not, have them update the condition to one that does become false and verify that the code written after the loop runs.

**Differentiation**

- Have students who finish early look up Runner Games to prepare and get ideas for the Capstone project they will be completing in Module 5.
- Have students who are struggling re-watch relevant cinematics and take notes on the examples given of simple while loops and while loops with counter variables/nested loops. They can use these examples as the basis for their solutions in the levels.
