# Chapter 3: Module 2 Overview

# **Terminology**

1. _Cutscene_ - Short videos that explain parts of the epic Ozaria narrative.
1. _Intro_ - These are combinations of Cinematics and Interactives that introduce new concepts in a scaffolded way.Â 
    1. _Cinematic_ - Expositional dialogue that introduces concepts in an engaging back-and-forth between characters.
    1. _Concept Check_ - Formative checks for student understanding presented in varied formats, including drag-and-drop and code ordering questions.
1. _Practice Level_ - Game-play in which students are practicing concepts that they have been introduced to in Intros.
1. _Challenge Level_ - Game-play in which students are assessed on key concepts they should have mastered in a module.

# Summaries

## Intro: Cleaning the Mess

**Cinematic: Gardening**

The hero discusses the effects of the Time Storm with Capella, who has aged. She instructs the hero to help clean up Haven with their totems.

## Practice Level: Irrigation

Students repeat the same actions multiple times in a program. This builds context for why they may want to use loops in the future.

## Intro: For Loops

**Cinematic: For Loops**

The hero meets Yug, and Capella explains for loops.

**Concept Check: Pseudocode Loops**

Students arrange pseudocode blocks to repeat the desired actions in sequence.

**Cinematic: Making Things Easier**

Capella explains the syntax and structure of for loops.

## Practice Levels: Race for Water &amp; Water Stairs

Students use for loops to simplify repetitive actions.

## Intro: Changing Variables

**Cinematic: Blue Pies**

Capella explains how to use loops to update variables.

**Concept Check: Variables in Loops**

Students select the correct line of code to update a variable value.

**Cinematic: Better Tools**

Capella leaves the hero to complete the rest of the tasks.

## Practice Levels: Lighting the Way &amp; Incrementing Paths

Students use loops to update walk distance variables for movement patterns.

## Challenge Level: Spiral Streets

Students are assessed on understanding of variable manipulation within for loops.

## Intro: Inside Out

**Cinematic: Rift Watching**

Capella explains the time totem they need is in the Time Rift, and the hero must go find it. Octans explains how to use for loops in sequence.

**Interactive: Loops in Sequence**

Students insert the correct code statement into a sequence with for loops.

**Cinematic: Onward**

Octans and the hero discuss what&#39;s next.

## Practice Levels: Through Together - Plus Minus Bridges

Students use loops in sequence to complete challenges with the hero and Mouse.

## Challenge Level: Eye of the Storm

Students are assessed on ability to use for loops in sequence with other code statements and for loops.

## Intro: The Eye

The hero makes it to the eye of the Time Rift, and Mouse is missing!
