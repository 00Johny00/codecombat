##### Unit Overview
# Prologue: The Sky Mountain

_Prologue: The Sky Mountain_ content is designed to get students excited about the world of Ozaria and comfortable writing code in the platform. There are key computer science concepts that are touched on in the first set of content to set students up for more robust lessons later on. There are slight differences in the content and materials between the Prologue and the later content, listed below:

1. The Sky Mountain will not have summative assessment built in, but the later units will have levels that serve as summative assessment and rubrics for Capstone projects will assess content and skills in a more targeted way.
1. The Capstone project for The Sky Mountain is more scaffolded, with fewer opportunities for student creativity than future projects given the introductory nature of the module.
1. There are fewer Concept Checks (formative assessments) in The Sky Mountain than in later content, as students spend most of their time guided through a Capstone project.

#### **Terminology**

1. _Cutscene_ - Short videos that explain parts of the epic Ozaria narrative.
1. _Intro_ - These are combinations of Cinematics and Concept Checks that introduce new concepts in a scaffolded way. 
    1. _Cinematic_ - Expositional dialogue that introduces concepts in an engaging back-and-forth between characters. 
    1. _Concept Check_ - Formative checks for student understanding presented in varied formats, including drag-and-drop questions and code ordering questions.
1. _Practice Level_ - Game-play in which students are practicing concepts that they have been introduced to in Cinematics/Concept Check flows.
1. _Capstone_ - Projects used to assess students’ knowledge of a Unit’s content and give them opportunities to explore creative design. Students will finish Capstones with a shareable product.
    1. _Stage_ - A single milestone of the Capstone project that helps students reach achievable, chunked goals.

## Summaries

We are introduced to the Hero, a teenager from a small village at the foot of the Great Mountain.
