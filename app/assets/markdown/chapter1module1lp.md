##### Chapter 1: Module 1 Lesson Plan
# Module 1: Algorithms and Syntax

## Overview

Module 1 consists of all the content from the beginning of _Chapter 1: The Moon Dancers_ until **The Debugger**.

This Lesson Plan will help you to facilitate Module 1 of _Chapter 1: The Moon Dancers_ in your classroom. Students will get an introductory overview of algorithms and common syntax rules in either JavaScript or Python.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this Ozaria module, students will be able to:

**Sequences and Algorithms**

- Modify sequences to complete a goal.
- Define the term algorithm.
- Write  algorithms to complete defined goals.

**Syntax**

- Explain what syntax is.
- Identify correct syntax in short code snippets.

### CSTA Standards

This module was designed to align to the following K-12 CSTA standards:

- 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences or simple loops, to express an idea or address a problem.
- 1A-AP-11: Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.
- 1A-AP-15: Using correct terminology, describe steps taken and choices made during the iterative process of program development.

## Recommended Prep

To prepare to support students as they work through Module 1 of _Chapter 1: The Moon Dancers_, it is highly recommended that you:

Work through _Chapter 1: The Moon Dancers_ Module 1 on your own.
- As you’re working through, note down places where you were tripped up or had misunderstandings. These will likely be the same places where students struggle.
- Get familiar with all the systems within the code editor including:

**Goals**
![Goals displayed in Level UI in the top-right corner](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/goals.png)
- Check off automatically as students complete various checkpoints in the levels and projects. 
- Ensure students use these to guide their work on levels and milestones. 

**Code Bank**
![Code Bank displayed on the left-hand side](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/codebank.png)
- A resource for students to see methods and tools they can use in their programs. This will give them descriptions of each method/tool and examples to work from. 
- Ensure students look at these before asking about what step they should take next in problem-solving.

**Error Messages**
![Error message pointing at student code](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/errormessages.png)
- These will pop up automatically when students have errors, either in syntax or logic. 
- Ensure students read these to understand where in their code something has gone wrong.

**Vega Messages**
![Vega Messages displayed in top-left corner](/images/pages/teachers/resources/markdown/chapter1/vegamessages.png)
- Messages that serve as additional hints and support.
- Both include introductory messages and, in some levels, messages triggered by specific interaction.

## In Classroom

### Lesson Facilitation

Once they have started in Module 1, students will be able to move through at their own pace. If you would like to stop students at key checkpoints (refer to the Module 1 Overview as a roadmap) to make sure the class is on the same page, you could do so in the following ways:

- Have students pause once they reach a new Cutscene, and watch Cutscenes together as a class.
    - When to use this method: When you have students who usually work at roughly the same pace and you want students to be approximately at the same place in the narrative to foster a sense of class community.
- Have students pause once they reach Concept Checks.
    - When to use this method: When you want to leverage Concept Checks as formative assessment. You can go over the answer to the Concept Chec as a whole class so students who are having trouble with the concepts can review before moving on.

### Common Student Misconceptions

- Students, especially those coming from drag-and-drop programming language backgrounds, may struggle with the transition to typed code. If you find that a large number of students are having trouble adjusting to typing in code or understanding the available systems, you can do a demo where you work step-by-step through a level and explain your steps along the way.

### Extensions and Differentiation
**Extensions for advanced students**
- Students who finish early can move on to Module 2.

**Differentiation for students who are struggling**
- Direct students to go back to the map and re-watch the Intro to better retain introduced content.
