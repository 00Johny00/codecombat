# Chapter 1 Module 6 Lesson Plan: Capstone

# Overview

- Assessment Objectives
    - This Capstone will allow students to demonstrate mastery of the following concepts:
        - Algorithms (Module 1)
        - Debugging (Module 2)
        - Variables (Module 3)
        - Conditionals (Module 4)
    - Students will create a storytelling project that provides an opportunity to showcase their creativity.
- Standards
    - This unit was designed to align to the following K-12 CSTA standards:
        - 1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.
        - 1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.
        - 1B-AP-15: Test and debug (identify and fix errors) in a program or algorithm to ensure it runs as intended.
        - 1B-AP-09: Create programs that use variables to store and modify data.
        - 1A-AP-15: Using correct terminology, describe steps taken and choices made during the iterative process of program development. 

# Materials

- Module Overview
- Project Rubric
- Reflection Activity

# Instructional Tips

In this Module, students will be creating their own projects that showcase their creativity and the skills that they learned throughout Unit 1.

Ensure that students have access to the Project Rubric so they know what the requirements are and can keep those in mind as they plan and develop their projects.

Students may work at different paces, so encourage those who work faster to go beyond the bare minimum requirements and create something unique and creative.
