# Sample Rubric -  _Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers_

This sample rubric is designed for you to evaluate your students&#39; progress on their Capstone projects for _Chapter 2: The Moon Dancers._ You should feel free to adapt and expand this rubric as needed for your classroom.

It is recommended that you use this rubric in conjunction with a writing or oral activity in which students explain the steps they took to create their Capstone projects. Some questions to ask are:

- **Algorithms**: Why did it matter that your code had a specific order?
- **Algorithms**: How did you use what you learned about algorithms in your Capstone project?
- **Algorithms**: Did your algorithm change along the way?
- **Debugging**: What&#39;s one error you ran into that you had to fix? Was it a syntax or logic error? **** 
- **Debugging**: How did you fix the error that you encountered?
- **Variables**: Where did you have to use variables in this project? 
- **Variables**: How did you name your variable? Why?
- **Conditionals**: Why was it necessary to use if statements in this project?
- **Conditionals**: Did you need to use if/else statements? Why or why not?
- **Capstone Methods**: Which of the methods in the method bank did you use? How did you find out more about how to use them?

|  | 1 (low) | 2 | 3 (high) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Algorithms | Student cannot explain how the sequence of their code affects the story. | Student can explain the sequence of their code, but do not know how to connect it to the definition of an algorithm. | Student can explain the sequence of their code and connect it to their definition of an algorithm. |
| Debugging | Student cannot identify an error that they encountered. | Students can identify an error that they encountered, but unable to classify it. | Students can identify an error  they encountered, classify it, and explain their process of fixing it. |
| Variables | Student cannot identify the variables they used in their project. | Student can identify the variables they used in their project but cannot explain how they used names intentionally. | Student can identify variables they used in their project and can explain their approach to variable naming. |
| Conditionals | Student cannot explain why if statements were needed in this project. | Student can explain why if statements were necessary in this project, but cannot explain why they did/didn&#39;t use if/else statements. | Student can explain why if statements were necessary and can explain why they did/didn&#39;t use if/else statements. |
